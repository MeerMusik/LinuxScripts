# LICENSE
The Content in this Repository is Dual-Licensed under The Unlicense (Public Domain) OR under the CC0-1.0 Universal License (Public Domain with Fallback Mechanism).

If you live in a Jurisdiction like Germany or anywhere else outside the USA which
1. does not acknowledge Public Domain at all OR
2. does only acknowledge some Parts of Public Domain

and therefore The Unlicense is deemed illegal or invalid, choose the CC0-1.0 Universal License with the Fallback Mechanism.

Simplified Explanation: Both Licenses allow you to do with those Scripts whatever you want without mentioning my Name ('without giving me Credit' also known as 'No Attribution').

The Fallback Mechanism is made for Jurisdictions like Germany etc., to allow me (the 'Licensor') to give away all my Rights as far as the local Laws allow me to do so. So that you (the 'Licensee') can do whatever you want with whatever I have published under those License(s).

The huge Amount of different Jurisdictions and Copyright Laws are a horrible Mess and need those specific Statements unfortunately.

Also: Repositories got removed or hidden if they do not contain a License Document.

And as always the usual necessary Disclaimer: I AM NOT A LAWYER AND THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE. IF YOU NEED LEGAL ADVICE, CONSULT A LICENSED ATTORNEY.
