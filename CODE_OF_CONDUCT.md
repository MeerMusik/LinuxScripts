# Code of Conduct
++ LAST EDIT: 25th OF AUGUST 2021 ++

This Document was written based on past experiences. All Sections will be expanded as necessary.

It is a shame that a Code of Conduct is necessary at all. So please behave your self and let us all have a good time. Okay? Okay! Thank you!

## General Rules
1. Treat other People with Respect. You are not Anonymous. You are talking to real People. The Internet is not "Lawless"! Your Actions will have Consequences!
2. If you have a Reason to criticise: Do it in a ! constructive ! way

Examples can be found here:
1. https://github.community/t/being-toxic-is-not-constructive-criticism/10225
2. https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/constructive-criticism

## Spoken Language is English
1. Spoken Language is English. If you need to use a Translator - it is perfectly fine. My Mother Tongue is German and my English has become horrible due to lack of practicising throughout the years as well<br>
1.1 If you write in ANY other Language than English, I will ask you to translate it. No need to excuse yourself for using a Translator - no matter how good or bad the Result is. Even a bad Translation will lead to a good Discussion over time<br>
1.2 If you do not translate your Issue, I will give it a very low Priority, as I obviously can not understand it. Also: Manual Translations to a Language I do not understand, usually lead to missing Important Details or will result in a wrong meaning or wrong wording, because I do not know the often existing nuances of a Language<br>
1.3 If you plan to write in German, please Translate to English - no exceptions :)

Here are some Links to Online Translators (No explicit Recommendation! Based on what I found during a Quick Search in June 2021! Make sure to remove all Personal Information before using any Translation Service!):
1. Deepl.com - based in Cologne Germany. (You can use the Free manual Translation): https://www.deepl.com/translator <br>
1.1 Deepl.com Privacy Policy: https://www.deepl.com/en/privacy/ <br>
2. Google Translator (Requires a Google Account): https://translate.google.com/

ALWAYS REMOVE PRIVATE INFORMATIONS BEFORE USING AN ONLINE TRANSLATOR! ALL DATA SUBMITTED WILL BE ADDED TO THE DATABASE FOR TRAINING! DEPENDING ON THE SERVICE YOU ARE USING: PERSONAL DATA WILL OFTEN BE USED FOR OTHER THINGS LIKE TARGETED MARKETING, TRACKING YOU ETC.! ESPECIALLY BUT NOT LIMITED TO WHEN USING ANY TYPE OF GOOGLE SERVICE!

If you know other good Online Translators: Feel free to let us know!

## Bannable Behaviour
The following Reasons will lead to a Temporary Ban of 7 Days for the first Violation of the Code of Conduct and the second time to a Permanent Ban:

1. Publishing other Peoples private Information without explicit permission
2. Public or private harassment
3. Commenting on (including but not limited to) other Peoples Characteristics, Believes, Political Opinions, Age, Body Size, Disability, Ethnicity, Gender Identity and Expression, Level of Experience, Nationality, Personal Appearance, Race, Religion, Sexual Identity and Orientation.
4. Sexual Harassment of any kind including but not limited to use of sexualized Language or Imagery and unwelcome sexual Attention or Advances
5. Threatening People. Including but not limited to<br>
5.1 Threat of violence<br>
5.2 Threatening to paying someone a visit<br>
5.3 Threatening to harm someone<br>
5.4 Threatening to watch how someone will get hurt<br>
5.5 Sending someone Text(s), Image(s), Video(s) or other Media describing or showing People getting harmed as well as sending a URI or URL to such content<br>
5.6 Including but not limited to People related to the Person threatened, as well as Friends, Colleagues, Co-Workers, Neighbours<br>
6. Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments
7. Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

--- More will be added as necessary ---

## Discussing a Ban
1. I believe in second Chances. That is why you get another chance after 7 Days
2. Unless multiple People state in a believable way, that I misunderstood something, I will not waste my time to Discuss any kind of temporary or permanent Ban<br>
2.1 Creating additional Accounts and / or using existing Accounts to fake a Request to Discuss a Ban or support to undo the Ban etc., will lead to a permanent Ban

## Permanent Ban
1. If you are violating any of the above mentioned Rules a second time, you will get permanently banned!
2. A Ban is always linked to a Person or Organization and not limited to a specific Account<br>
2.1 If you post something under another Account, it is a Violation of the Code of Conduct. Any current and future Accounts held by the Banned Person or Organization will be banned as well<br>
2.2 Using another Account during a temporary Ban will result in a permanent Ban of all current and future Accounts held by the Banned Person or Organization<br>
3. Whenever necessary, I will also report your Accounts and Activities to the Service which is holding your Account(s)

### Necessary extensions and additions
As we all know, some Individuals always find a new way to misbehave and say "It is not part of the Terms, so I can do it!". Wrong! I will add any new way you find to abuse the Terms and will Ban you anyway. No Discussion. No Hairsplitting. No theatrics.

### First a Warning, then the Ban
This is how the Rules will be applied:
1. The first time you violate the Rules, you will get a Warning
2. The second time you violate the Rules, you will be banned for 7 Days
3. The third time you violate the Rules, you will be banned permanently

Additionally:
1. If you get a Warning and complain about it in a way which violates the Rules in itself, you will instantly get banned for 7 Days!
2. Doing something similar after the 7 Day Ban, will result in a permanent Ban immediately!

## Results of being Banned temporarily
As GitHub allows temporary Bans only on Enterprise Accounts = Organizations, I have to induce a Full Ban for these 7 Days! This has a severe impact! What this means in detail, can you read here:
1. https://docs.github.com/en/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/blocking-a-user-from-your-personal-account

I have no Idea if your commits and comments will be restored after you have been unbanned. Personally, I do not think so. But this is just a guess.

To reduce the risk of losing all your contributions, just do not misbehave in the first place :)

Thank you and have a fantastic time everyone :)
